Fraud Detection is a challenging machine learning task that requires a deep dive into complex data. The goal is to accurately classify data with numerous categorical variables and a substantial amount of missing values, all while managing an imbalanced target variable. This project pushes the boundaries of data processing, feature engineering, and model optimization to enhance the reliability of fraud detection outcomes.
